# 30 June 2024:

Here is what I have done so far for today:
1. Spend 30 minutes practising VimBeGood.
2. Went through <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen's dotfiles</a>, specifically through his Neovim config, and implemented what was valuable. Added and configured <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim" target="_blank">refactoring.nvim</a>, a Neovim plugin.

## refactoring.nvim:
I added the following mappings:
```custom/mappings.lua
M.refactoring = {
  n = {
    ["<leader>ri"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor inline_var") end, "Refactor inline_var" },
    ["<leader>rI"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor inline_func") end, "Refactor inline_func" },
    ["<leader>rb"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor extract_block") end, "Refactor extract_block" },
    ["<leader>rbf"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor extract_block_to_file") end, "Refactor extract_block_to_file" },
  },
  x = {
    ["<leader>re"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor extract") end, "Refactor extract" },
    ["<leader>rf"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor extract_to_file") end, "Refactor extract_to_file" },
    ["<leader>rv"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor extract_var") end, "Refactor extract_var" },
    ["<leader>ri"] = { function() refactor_with_args("Refactor inline_var") end, "Refactor inline_var" },
  }
}
```
Not only that, I also refactored my mapping to be more modular. I also integrated `refactoring.nvim`, with telescope, and added custom keymap:
