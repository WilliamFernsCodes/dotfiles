# 7 July 2024:

Here is what I have done so far for today:
1. Spend 35 minutes practising VimBeGood.
2. Went through <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen's dotfiles</a>, specifically through his Neovim config, and implemented what was valuable. Added and configured <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim" target="_blank">refactoring.nvim</a>, a Neovim plugin. 

## refactoring.nvim:
I went through refactoring.nvim, and implemented some mappings:
```mappings.lua
M.refactoring = {
  n = {
    -- other mappings
   ["<leader>pv"] = {
      function()
        require('refactoring').debug.print_var()
      end,
      "Print Variable"
    },
    ["<leader>rc"] = {
      function()
        require('refactoring').debug.cleanup({})
      end,
      "Clean up print statements"
    },
  },
  x = {
    -- other mappings
    ["<leader>pv"] = {
      function()
        require('refactoring').debug.print_var()
      end,
      "Print Variable"
    },
  }
}
```

## Debug Refactoring Examples:
Here is how to use it:
1. Printf - print a function:
```python
# before
def test(): # using <leader>rpf on this line
    print("testing")

# after:
def test(): # using <leader>rpf on this line
    # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINTF_START__
    print("FaceTrackingVideo#test 1") # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINTF_END__
    print("testing")
```
2. PrintV - print a variable
```python
# before:
test_var = 1 + 2 # using <leader>pv on this line

# after:
test_var = 1 + 2
    # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINT_VAR_START__
    print(f" test_var: {str(test_var)}") # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINT_VAR_END__
```
3. Clear - clear all print statements
```python
# before
test_var = 1 + 2
    # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINT_VAR_START__
    print(f" test_var: {str(test_var)}") # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINT_VAR_END__

def test():
    # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINTF_START__
    print("FaceTrackingVideo#test 1") # __AUTO_GENERATED_PRINTF_END__
    print("testing")

# after
test_var = 1 + 2

def test():
    print("testing")
```

## Other:
I also learned how to go into Replace mode, by typing "R". It allows you to replace the current text you are on. It is quite awesome.

I also learned how to open up the "help tags" in Telescope. Help tags are almost like builtin documentation inside of Neovim. For me, the mapping is `<leader>fh`, which stands for "find help". I will start using it when searching for something.

## Conclusion:
This is it for today. I also have added persistent breakpoints for neovim, to keep breakpoints even if I close neovim entirely. I used a plugin for that. Will document all the changes I made for that soon. Later on I will implement debugging for Node JS & TypeScript applications entirely in Neovim. I will watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul_WPhS2bis" target="_blank">this video</a>, follow along and do additional research if I want to add something else.
