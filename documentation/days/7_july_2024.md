# 7 July 2024:

Here is what I have done so far for today:
1. Spend 35 minutes practising VimBeGood.
2. Went through <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen's dotfiles</a>, specifically through his Neovim config, and implemented what was valuable. Added and configured <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim" target="_blank">refactoring.nvim</a>, a Neovim plugin. 

I went through refactoring.nvim, and implemented some mappings:
```mappings.lua
M.refactoring = {
  n = {
    -- other mappings
   ["<leader>pv"] = {
      function()
        require('refactoring').debug.print_var()
      end,
      "Print Variable"
    },
    ["<leader>rc"] = {
      function()
        require('refactoring').debug.cleanup({})
      end,
      "Clean up print statements"
    },
  },
  x = {
    -- other mappings
    ["<leader>pv"] = {
      function()
        require('refactoring').debug.print_var()
      end,
      "Print Variable"
    },
  }
}
```

I also learned how to go into Replace mode, by typing "R". It allows you to replace the current text you are on. It is quite awesome.

I also learned how to open up the "help tags" in Telescope. Help tags are almost like builtin documentation inside of Neovim. For me, the mapping is `<leader>fh`, which stands for "find help". I will start using it when searching for something.
