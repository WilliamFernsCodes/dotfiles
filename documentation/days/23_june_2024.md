# 23 June 2024:

Here is what I have done so far for today:
1. Went through <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen's dotfiles</a>, and implemented what was valuable
2. 
3. 

## Neovim Config Changes:
Here is what I have changed in my neovim config:
1. Added command **<leader>cz**, which opens a floating terminal, automatically running the `cz commit` terminal command. This is helpful, as Vim Fugitive doesn't have Commitizen support.
2. Added **<leader>ga** command in Vim Fugitive config, to run the git command `git add .`. This is helpful, I don't have to type in the command `G add .`. This works better.
3. Cloak.lua plugin installed, working as expected. What does this plugin do? Well, I have configured it to hide my `.env` environment variables by replacing the values with "*" characters. I can run `:CloakToggle` to toggle the variables. This is helpful if you maybe record videos, and you don't want to accidentally leak your environment variables. For more information on how to configure it, and the other command, check out <a href="https://github.com/laytan/cloak.nvim" target="_blank">cloak.nvim</a>.
