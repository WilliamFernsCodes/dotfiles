# 14 July 2024:

Here is what I have done so far for today:
1. Spend 45 minutes practising VimBeGood.
2. Spent 2 hours setting up nvim-dap for Node JS and TypeScript. Almost done. It doesn't work yet. I have made a separate branch. Will merge it once it works as expected.

## Conclusion:
This is it for today. I made a bunch of config changes, along with adding in custom mappings throughout this week (from the 7th - 14th). I will document it next week Sunday. Today was really busy.
