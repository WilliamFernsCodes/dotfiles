# 14 July 2024:

Here is what I have done so far for today:
1. Spend 45 minutes practising VimBeGood.
2. 

## Conclusion:
This is it for today. I also have added persistent breakpoints for neovim, to keep breakpoints even if I close neovim entirely. I used a plugin for that. Will document all the changes I made for that soon. Later on I will implement debugging for Node JS & TypeScript applications entirely in Neovim. I will watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul_WPhS2bis" target="_blank">this video</a>, follow along and do additional research if I want to add something else.
